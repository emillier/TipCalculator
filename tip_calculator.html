HTML feedback (I know this isnt asked for but might be valuable)

Using tabs *and* spaces = bad (best practices). I'll show you how to 'show invisible' characters in sublime so you can see them and know it's happening. Also I'll show you something called editorconfig / how to configure sublime DONE

Indents aren't 2 spaces (our styleguide) DONE

If you use the same value for the input names and ids it makes things easier to remember DONE

You sometimes have spaces after the word 'class' which should be removed (invalid html otherwise) DONE

Your H1 has an H2 closing tag (invalid html) DONE

You don't need to have the / in the BR tags. This is XHTML and pretty much a forgotten about syntax. If you do want to use this syntax, the / should be after the BR characters, e.g. <br/> This is because we're opening and closing the tag at the same time DONE

You forgot to close your .main-background div
